# 3rd-Thumb
This is a repo for a 3rd thumb project I've been developing on the side for fun. I'll try to update this more over time but school keeps me pretty busy.

The core of the project is a print in place 3rd thumb with 2 degrees of freedom: radial flexion and bending.

The thumb is printed on my Snapmaker A350 with a dual extruder, using TPU as a soft outer layer (skin) and PLA as a hard inner layer (bones). As far as I know, I'm the first person in the world to develop an artificial bone analog in a prosthetic like this. This setup grants quite a bit of grip strength to the thumb, as the TPU skin is able to naturally deform to what it's grabbing while pushing against the PLA bones for support.
